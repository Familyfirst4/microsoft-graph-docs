In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with one of the following role permissions:
- `microsoft.directory/roleDefinitions/standard/read` (least privileged)
- `microsoft.directory/roleDefinitions/allProperties/read`
- `microsoft.directory/roleDefinitions/allProperties/allTasks`

The least privileged roles supported for this operation are as follows, in the order of least to most privileged:

- Directory Readers
- Global Reader
- Privileged Role Administrator
